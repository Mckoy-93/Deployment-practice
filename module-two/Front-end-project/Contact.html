          <p>     I am an aspriring software engineer. This Front-end-Project gave me the chance to show my interest in the television series Rick and Morty. I have had a chance to explore my creativity with this project. I hope to build more on this project(website), to show how my skills progress. My goal is to become a full-stack software engineer and to hopefully progress and become a white hat hacker. This is just the start! I hope all viewers enjoy my page! Especially all the Rick and Morty fans! Enjoy!
